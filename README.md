# yet_another_fraction_calculator

Yet another calculator for real to rational number.
This one is very cheap, as it brute forces the closest ratio.
The maximum denominator can be set, but defaults to 128.

I intend to use this tool when I measure things in inch and need to know what
kind of inch fraction that might be.

There might be better algorithms for findings rational numbers, for example read
